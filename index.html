Don't miss the sunset from Devigudda.
(Hosts take you to the top in a 4×4). The sunset from here is the best one I've seen till now.

                                       <p>Wonderful home stay,especially for larger groups. The tent accommodation was certainly unique among the concrete hotels. It provides a chance for large families and friends to spend some valuable time under one roof. Waking up to sunshine cutting through coffee estate trees, rivulet flowing all through the day, birds chirping and peacock dancing was indeed a different experience altogether. Best part was the food that was offered during our stay. People from other parts than Karnataka needn't go far in search of Malnad cuisine, River Cross Estate does it elegantly. From here, Mullayanagiri, Kudremukh and Devaramane peaks are accessible. But, people who like to spend time close to nature will love this place hands down.

                                       <p>River cross estate was simply heavenly.I'd seen the website and had checked it out on TripAdvisor too, but it simply exceeded all expectations. A short drive from Mudigere town(5kms) through the lush green coffee estates took us to the estate.we were just taken aback by the beauty. The cottage sits in the valley with natural stream flowing in front of it. The sound of the stream is a music to the ears. There is lush green coffee estate spreading out all around us and the peacocks just sing all the time. The hosts are super friendly and the food was amazing. Just like the reviews suggest, you really have to go there to taste the food.The hosts are super friendly, we and so are their dogs!(Raju, pinky and Dooby!) We felt like family by the time we left! It was an amazing break and worth every penny, will be back soon!
